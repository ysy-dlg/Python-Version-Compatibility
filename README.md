## File List
**PythonSnippetVer:** This directory stores Python code snippets extracted from the SOTorrent version 20_03 database. The issues they belong to contain Python tags. The code snippets in this file face compatibility issues between Python 2.7 and Python 3.x. The code snippets in this file are not compatible with Python 2.7.

**Output:** This directory contains the outcomes of parsing code snippets from PythonSnippetVer across different Python versions. For instance, the file named py37.csv catalogs the compilability of these snippets for Python 3.7, detailing each snippetâ€™s ID, PostId, and compilation outcome (where 1 signifies successful compilation by Python 3.7, and 0 denotes failure), along with the error message for snippets that encountered compilation issues.
